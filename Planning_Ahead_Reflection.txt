Planning Ahead / Reflection

Our product could definetly be developed further than the stage it's currently at, our light sensor is limited in it's range of detection so a more
advanced sensor would provide more website options to the user. It might be possible to utilize google lens to show a website photo and bring the user
to that website. If we had a light sensor that detects colour as well, we could set diferent websites to open according to colour. If it were to be
mass marketed then the Pi and all the circuitry would be contained within a main body with the sensor and button on the sides so the user can access 
them.
